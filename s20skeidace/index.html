					<p><em>How Many Reindeer Does Santa Have?</em></p>
					<p>Traditionally, there are eight reindeer (Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen). 
					Rudolph is the ninth addition (made famous by the song about his red nose).</p>
					<p>It’s true, a long-long time ago a poet Clement C. Moore, scribed Santa’s Reindeer into existence by saying,
					“Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer, and Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Dunder and Blixem!”.</p>
					<p>Rudolph “The Red-Nosed” Reindeer came into fruition when a copywriter created Rudolph to help with a Christmas store promotion.
					Today, we don’t think of Rudolph as a promotion but rather as a bright-nosed, joyful reindeer who helped guide Santa’s sleigh that one cloudy night. So in total, the eight original reindeer from Moore’s poem plus Rudolf gives Santa nine reindeer. 
					Their names are Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Dunder, Blixem, and Rudolf.</p>
