                    <p><em>Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A.</em> ir Itālijas autobūves uzņēmums, kas ir bāzēts Turīnā, Itālijā. Tas tika dibināts kā A.L.F.A. 1910. gada 24. jūnijā Milānā. Kopš 1911. gada uzņēmums ir iesaistījies sacīkšu auto ražošanā, kā arī tam ir dārgu sporta auto ražošanas reputācija.</p>
                    
                    <p>Uzņēmuma īpašnieks laikā no 1932. līdz 1986. gadam bija Itālijas uzņēmums Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale. 1986. gadā to pārdeva Fiat. 2007. gadā Fiat reorganizēja savu organizatorisko struktūru, un Alfa Romeo kļuva par Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A. meitas uzņēmumu Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A. 2014. gadā mātes uzņēmums apvienojās ar ASV autobūvētāju Chrysler, izveidojot Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, un Alfa Romeo palika FCA Italy pārvaldībā. 2021. gada 16. janvārī tika pabeigta Fiat Chrysler Automobiles apvienošanās ar Francijas Groupe PSA, un Alfa Romeo nonāca apvienotā uzņēmuma Stellantis pakļautībā.</p>

                        <p>The early 1970s 2000 GT Veloce is derived from the Giulia line of cars that began production in the early 60s and terminated shortly after the Vietnam War. The naming of the different models can be somewhat confusing as they used different combinations of names and numbers and letters, but with its quad headlights and unbroken crease from front to rear, the 2000 GT Veloce is the high point in terms of design. As such, well-sorted examples continue to retain their value and can fetch more than $70,000 at auction.</p>

                        <p>After having left the American market for many years, Alfa Romeo decided to come back with a tour de force. While CNN labels the official return of Alfa in 2014, the 8C was imported starting in 2008 at a price of $260,000. The 8C was not accompanied by a full brand introduction with a new dealer network, the 8C sold more like a niche supercar, which is an accurate description of it.</p>

                        <p>Styled by Marcello Gandini, the same gentleman who penned the lines of the iconic Lamborghini Miura, the Montreal shows off a clear influence from the Italian bull. However, the Montreal is a front-engine GT car powered by a 2.6 liter twin-cam V8 with SPICA mechanical fuel injection. The travesty of laying out the many alluring facets of this car in writing is it disallows the reader the opportunity to take in the sonorous delight of the Montreal's mechanical heart, popping and growling through its twin chrome exhaust tips lined up in the center of its tail (via: Classic and Sports Car).</p>

                        <p><b>1995-2003</b></p>
                        <p>Although never imported into the U.S., the GTV would have been at home among the Rx-7, 300 ZX, SL500, and Dodge Stealth. It is a 2+2 setup with a really slick wedge shape and oddly small headlights. The interior is a well-sorted luxury affair with heavily bolstered leather seats and a handsome dashboard complete with triple gauges on the center stack. Ultimate Specs tells us it is powered by a 24 valve 3.0-liter V6 engine that outputs 217 horsepower. With a curb weight of just over 3000 pounds, the GTV shoots to 60 in just 6.7 seconds with a top speed of 149 MPH, a respectable time for the mid-nineties. One of the things that are unmistakable Alfa is the appearance under the hood. This car is beautifully styled; even the engine is a work of art. The chrome intake tubes and finned valve covers show that, for Italians, style is everything.</p>

                        <p><b>1966-1969</b></p>
                        <p>While the Spider was in production from 1966 to 1994, it was the first iteration that captured America's attention, most notably due to its inclusion in The Graduate with Dustin Hoffman. Not only was it Hoffman's breakout role, it brought the same attention to the car, although this did not translate to sales success, according to Collier Auto Media. Still, the association with the movie led Alfa to add a Spider model dubbed The Graduate to its trim offerings later on in the eighties. Regardless of its sales success, it is a handsome roadster, powered by a twin-cam 1.6L engine. Its distinctive lines and boattail rear end were the last ones drawn by Battista "Pinin" Farina, founder of the Pininfarina automotive styling house, in his career. For Farina, the Spider is certainly a high note to go out on.</p>

                        <p><b>1967-1969</b></p>
                        <p>The Stradale was hand-built by Autodelta, Alfa's racing development department, and designed by Bertone protege Franco Scaglione. Top Gear also tells us the original price of the car in today's money was around $120,000, which is not considered high in today's market, but exceedingly expensive in the 1960s, even talking in inflation-adjusted dollars. Regardless, only 18 copies were made over the two-year period and that makes them exceedingly valuable today. Pricing them is difficult as they rarely come up for sale but it would be easy to surmise an auction could go over the $10 million mark.</p>

                        <p>An oft-overlooked Alfa of the 1980s, the Alfetta, is an interesting choice of automobile. Motor Trend called it, "tragically flawed, but charismatic." Those are choice wors for this vehicle. The Alfetta sat in the market in the sports touring segment along with the Porshe 944, and, like the Porsche, featured a transaxle at the rear to aid in achieving 50/50 weight distribution. A few other unique features of the Alfetta include the clutch being mounted at the transaxle at the rear, meaning the engine remained untouched for a clutch service, inboard disc brakes in the rear, and a DeDion bar rear suspension setup. The engine is a V6 producing 155 horsepower using a twin-cam setup with hemispherical combustion chambers.</p>

                        <p>With modern cars being designed by computers and trying to achieve the lowest drag coefficient, many cars almost look the same. It takes skill to produce a sedan that really stands out, and the Giulia does this fairly well. Speaking about the newest model on sale, Road and Track says it comes with a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine producing 280 horsepower while the Giulia Quadrifoglio sports a V6 with 505 ponies. They also recommend seeking out a good warranty as reliability issues continue to be associated with new Alfas.</p>

Unlike many of Alfa's most attractive historical designs, the 4C was designed in-house by Centro Stile Alfa Romeo and it retains that unique Alfa look that permeates this brand full of automotive beauty.</p>
